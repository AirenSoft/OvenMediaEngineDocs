# Test Player

We provide you our test player to make sure that OvenMediaEngine works well. Most browsers prohibit access to TLS-based HTTPS site through unsecured HTTP or WebSocket \(WS\) for security reasons. Thus, we have prepared the HTTP or HTTPS based player as follows:

| Site URL | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [http://demo.ovenplayer.com](http://demo.ovenplayer.com) | Player without TLS that can test all streaming URLs such as `WS://`, `WSS://`, `HTTP://`, `HTTPS://` |
| [https://demo.ovenplayer.com](https://demo.ovenplayer.com) | Player with TLS that can only test `WSS://` and `HTTPS://` based streaming URLs |
